# COVID-19---Continents

This repository shows the results of time series clustering with dynamic time warping (DTW) for COVID-19 data referring to the period January 22, 2020 – November 30, 2020 for each continent. The coronavirus library (Krispin & Byrnes, 2020) is used for cluster analysis in R (R Core, 2020). We use dtwclust (Sarda-Espinosa, 2019) for time-series clustering with DTW, ggplot2 (Wickham H. , 2016) for visualization, and ggdendro (Vries & Ripley, 2020) libraries for dendrograms. Also, we use gtable (Wickham & Pederse, 2019), grid (R Core, 2020) and gridExtra (Auguie, 2017) to arrange plots. The World map is generated with maps (Becker, Wilks, Brownrigg, Minka, & Deckmyn, 2018). Along with all these libraries, tidyverse (Wickham, et al., 2019), readr (Wickham, Hester, & Francois, 2018), dplyr (Wickham, François, Henry, & Müller, 2020) and tidyr (Wickham H. , 2020) libraries are used to organize the data and the codes.
